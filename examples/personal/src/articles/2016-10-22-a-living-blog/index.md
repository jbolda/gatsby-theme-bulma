Hello everyone! I am setting up a sort of quasi-blog. I enjoy solving problems, travel, finance, business and programming. You may find various calculators that can run directly in your browser. I love traveling, and fully intend to chorincle my past adventures (with photos!) and thoughts on my travels. You may also find some productivity hacks here because a good business loves efficiency. I am a structural engineer by trade so you may see some musings on the industry, and meta-type thoughts on my other projects. Feel free to learn more about my story on my about page or contact me with any questions. I would love to see an email from you!
